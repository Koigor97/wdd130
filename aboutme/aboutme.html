    <h1>Samuel Turay</h1>
    <h3>Hello everyoneðŸ––.</h3>
    <p>My name is Samuel. I am Sierra Leone (West Africa), but presently staying in South Africa.
        My major is Applied Technology, with focus on Web and Computer programming,<br> Web Development, and Database. 
        I am currently on my first certificate - Web and Computer Programming, and I'm excited about it.
    </p>
    <p>
        I love photograpyðŸ“¸, movies, long drives and whiles listening to some Lofi-beats. I like good looking websites,
        and I would love to build beautiful and visual appealing websites. <br>
        I am fond of 3D looking, animation, and minimalistic websites and web apps. I look forward meeting you all 
        and working together during the semester.
